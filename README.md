🌐 Srihari Ponakala — Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!
This project represents my journey as a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer, built completely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It’s more than just a portfolio — it’s a creative expression of who I am as a developer, combining design, code, and storytelling in one place.

🧠 Overview

This portfolio website was created to showcase my professional background, technical skills, and selected projects.
I built everything myself from the ground up — no templates, no frameworks, just clean, optimized code written by hand.

The goal was to build something minimal, elegant, and interactive that reflects both technical craftsmanship and design simplicity.

🎯 Objectives

Build a fully responsive, single-page personal portfolio website from scratch.

Design a dark, modern theme using blue accents for a professional and minimal aesthetic.

Implement custom animations for smooth navigation and interactivity.

Present my skills, experience, and projects in a structured and visually clear way.

Host the website using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for easy access.

⚙️ Tech Stack

This website was developed using only core web technologies:

HTML5 — for structure and semantics.

CSS3 — for responsive design, styling, and animations.

JavaScript (Vanilla) — for dynamic behaviors and interactivity.

No external libraries, frameworks, or CMS platforms were used — ensuring full control over the design and performance.

🧩 Key Features

Clean & Modern UI: Minimal dark theme with blue highlights for a sleek, professional look.

Fully Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Animated Skills Carousel: Showcases technologies and tools with smooth motion and gentle rotations.

Compact Experience Timeline: Presents work experience concisely while linking to a detailed resume.

Project Showcase: Displays all projects in an interactive and organized layout.

Smooth Navigation & Transitions: Subtle scroll-based animations for a seamless user experience.

🧠 Development Approach

The website was developed following a content-first, design-next approach.
I started with the core structure in HTML, ensuring accessibility and semantic organization.
Then, I layered styles using Flexbox and CSS Grid, building responsive layouts that adapt naturally.
Animations and scroll interactions were written using pure JavaScript for smooth, lightweight transitions.

The project emphasizes:

Clean, maintainable code.

Scalability for future updates.

Aesthetics balanced with performance.

🚀 Deployment

This portfolio can be hosted using static deployment platforms such as:

GitHub Pages

Netlify

Vercel

The deployment process ensures quick load times, no build dependencies, and simple version control.

💡 Learning Outcomes

Building this project helped me:

Strengthen my core front-end development skills.

Practice responsive web design without relying on frameworks.

Learn how to create and optimize animations and interactions manually.

Understand hosting and deployment workflows for static sites.

Showcase my professional identity in a single, creative digital space.
